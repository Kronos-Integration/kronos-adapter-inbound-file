== Adapter Inbound File
This adapter open file streams and send them out as messages.
It could listen on directories for new files or it could be externally triggered.

=== Configuration
The configuration for this step is as follows.

.Message formats
[source,js]
----
{
  "regEx" : ".*\\.csv",      <1>
  "filter": filterFunction,  <2>
  "watchDir": directory      <3>
  "onlyReadNewFiles" : true  <4>
}
----
<1> (Optional)  A regular expression which will be matched against the file names changed. If the regEx did not
match no message will be generated.
<2> (Optional)  A custom function to filter the file names. The function looks like ''function (fileName){return true}''.
The function gets the file name as parameter and must return true or false.
<3> (Optional)  The directory which should be watched for changes.
<4> (Optional)  If set to true (default) then only new files added will be send. Else it will also
send the already existing files.

=== Endpoints
This Adapter has two endpoints. One 'out' endpoint which send out the messages with
the red stream and one 'in' endpoint for external trigger events.

==== out
This endpoint send out file read messages.

<2> The directory the file is in. Full qualified name.
<3> The file stat as generated by 'fs.stat'.
